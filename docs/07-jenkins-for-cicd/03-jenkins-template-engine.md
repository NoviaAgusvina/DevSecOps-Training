# Jenkins Template Engine

Jenkins Template Engine is a feature in Jenkins that allows you to define and manage job configurations as code. With the Jenkins Template Engine, you can create job templates that define the structure and settings of a job, and then use those templates to create multiple jobs with the same configuration. This can save time and reduce errors when managing a large number of similar jobs.

The Jenkins Template Engine works by defining a template job that includes placeholders for variables that can be customized for each individual job. You can define these placeholders using a simple syntax, such as ${VAR_NAME}, and then use them in the job configuration to define values for things like job names, Git repository URLs, build parameters, and more. When you create a new job from the template, you provide values for the placeholders, and the template engine generates a new job configuration file that includes the customized values.

The Jenkins Template Engine is built into Jenkins, and you can access it through the Jenkins user interface. To use the template engine, you need to have a basic understanding of Jenkins job configurations, as well as some familiarity with the syntax for defining templates and variables. There are also several plugins available that extend the functionality of the template engine, such as the Job DSL plugin, which allows you to define job templates using Groovy scripts.

Overall, the Jenkins Template Engine is a powerful feature that can help simplify and streamline the process of managing a large number of jobs in Jenkins. By defining job configurations as code, you can more easily version control your jobs, apply consistent settings across your jobs, and quickly create new jobs with customized settings.
